Removed pid from metric name to allow for cumulative metrics. This is the default. 
To revert it to the current behaviour use unique_pid = True on the factory constructor
    rc = TxMetricsFactory(..., unique_pid = True)

Documented what to do if the redis class is a lazyConnectionPool 

Added counter example
